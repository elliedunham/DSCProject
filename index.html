        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>This website is designed by Ellie Dunham and hosts her Data Science Capstone project. For the project, she worked with Dr. Jeffery Heath and Centre College Athletics to explore two important aspects in field hockey.</p>
        <h3>Field Hockey Game Win Probability</h3>
        <p>The first part of the project analyzed the win probability of a field hockey game. The model utilized all field hockey games played by schools in the Southern Atheltic Association.

    <h2>Field Hockey</h2>
        <p>Field hockey is a sport played around the world. With 10 field players and a goalie, the game is set on a 100 yard astro-turf pitch. The field is lined with two 25-yard lines. In order to score, the ball must be shot within the shooting circle. The shooting circle is improperly named as it is actually shaped as a semi-circle.</p>
        <p>An important rule of the game is the ball cannot touch the feet of any player, except the goalies, who are dressed in thick pads. </p>
