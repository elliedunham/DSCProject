                <h4>1: Data Scraping</h4>
                <p class="text-small">
                    I began this work in the summer 2020. I initally worked on a team lead by Dr. Heath. The team first begin with writing python scripts to web scrape play-by-play information from athletic websites.
                    I used the package BeautifulSoup to web scrape. Because a lot of the work was done in summer 2020, when I began to work on the project again in Fall 2022, I only needed to run the scripts againt to have raw data for the most recent seasons.
                </p>
                <h4>2: Cleaning the raw data</h4>
                <p>The raw data from athletic websites includes the play-by-play descriptions and game headers. </p>
                <p>The play-by-play tables included time of play, type of play, and the team responsible for the play. The header data included the location of the game, who was the home team, each teams' win-tie-loss records as well as the record in the southern athletic association. </p>
                <p>From the raw data, I wrote a few scripts that parsed through the play-by-play table counting the number of shots, substititutions, corners, cards, and saves each team had throughtout each minute of the game.</p>

                <h4>4: Evaluating the Models</h4>
